This GDI malware is able to overwrite the MBR, corrupt the registry, replicate itself, delete the BCD, move the mouse and all active windows, and change all labels to "NITRITE".

# ‚ù§Ô∏è For Skidders ‚ù§Ô∏è
I know some of you may skid this malware because of the open source code, so...

To prevent that, in order for your malware not to be taken down, you have to obey the restrictions of the GNU GPL v3.0 licence.
That way, if you EVER use its source code, you must release the source code of your project and credit me as well.
